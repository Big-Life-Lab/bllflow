# bllFlow package <img src="man/figures/pbl-sticker.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

**bllFlow** supports an open, transparent, pre-specified appraoch to statistical 
model development. 

### Is _bllflow_ for you?

Do you shudder at the thought of trying to update the analyses for a previous study? (let alone imagine someone else trying to replicate your analyses?)

Are your data and statistcal models becoming more complex, challenging to perform and difficult to report?

Are you concerned about the [misuse](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9) of statistical findings? But not sure about reporting all results of all analyses?

Do you want to adhere to reporting guidelines such as [TRIPOD](https://www.equator-network.org/2015/01/07/guidelines-for-reporting-multivariable-prediction-models-for-individual-prognosis-or-diagnosis-tripod-published/), [STROBE](http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/), and [RECORD](http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/record/)?

Do you work in teams that span disciplines and institutions?

We answered 'yes' to all these questions and then created _bllflow_ to improve our workflow. Our science quality and efficiency has improved and we're not going back.

### What does bllFlow do?
_bllflow_ is a workflow that facilitates transparent, reproducible, efficient analyses. The package was initially developed for projects where multiple people are working together (content experts, analysts, etc.). 

There there are three features of _bllflow_:

- **The Model Specification Workbook (MSW)** - CSV files that contain key information (metadata) about your data, model, the variables in your model, data cleaning and transformation steps and how to create output tables. 

- **Functions to perform routine data cleaning and transformation tasks** - _bllflow_ functions use the MSW as instructions perform regular data cleaning and variable transformation tasks. However, functions all  be used without pre-specifying analyses or using the Model Specification Workbook

- **Formatted output files, tables** - CSV files that contain results of your analyses in a consistent format. 

At any point of your analyses you:

- have labels for variables.
- have a log data cleaning and transformed variables (how your data has been cleaned and transformed).
- have a codebook, with information with data provenance of all variables.

_bllflow_ support metadata, including the Data Document Initiative ([DDI](https://ddialliance.org)). For predictive algorithms, _bllflow_ generates Predictive Model Modelling Language ([PMML](http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-3/GeneralStructure.html)) files for algorithm delployment

The documentation includes an example of a pre-specified survival model for people with primary biliary cirrhosis, replicating the model by 
[Dickerson et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2737595)  

## Installation
```
# If not installed, install the devtools
install.packages("devtools")

# then, install the package
devtools::install_github("Big-Life-Lab/bllFlow")
```
There are plans to submit bllFlow to CRAN once we include all seven steps of our 
workflow. Currently on step #4.
