## Plugin Usage

1. Open the project's 'Model Specification Worksheet (MSW)' (CSV file).

3. The generated project should be in a folder called "generated-project" within the folder
   containing the web specifications file.
   
The package requires a MSW CSV file that identifies:

2. Which transformation you would like performed.
