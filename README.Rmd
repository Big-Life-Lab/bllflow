[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

bllflow supports open, reproducible, efficient research. 

The package was originally developed for studies that develop predictive 
algoirthms using rountinely-collected health data. However, bllFlow can support 
others studies pre-specified analyses, particularly when there 
are multiple people working together create an analysis plan.
