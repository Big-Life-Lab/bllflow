# bllFlow package <img src="man/figures/pbl-sticker.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

**bllFlow** supports a open, transparent, pre-specified appraoch to model 
building. 

### Is this R package for you?

Are you a researcher or analyst 

### What does bllFlow 

The package was originally developed for support predictive models in health, 
particularly when there are multiple people working together (content experts, 
analysts, etc.). However, bllFlow can be used for a range of modelling appraoches.

The documentation includes an example of a pre-specified predictive model of 
primary biliary cirrhosis, replicating the model by 
[Dickerson et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2737595). However, 
functions for data cleaning, variable transformation and model reporting can all 
be used without pre-specifying analyses.
