# bllflow package <img src="man/figures/pbl-sticker.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

bllflow supports open, reproducible, efficient research. 

The package was originally created for studies that develop predictive 
algoirthms using rountinely-collected health data. However, bllflow can support 
other studies' pre-specified analyses, particularly when there 
are multiple people working together to create an analysis plan.
