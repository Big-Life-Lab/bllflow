# bllFlow package <img src="man/figures/pbl-sticker.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

bllFlow supports open, reproducible, efficient and robust research for teams. 

The package was originally developed for studies that develop predictive 
algoirthms using rountinely-collectec health data. However, bllFlow can support 
others studies that strive for pre-specified analyses, particularly when there 
are multiple people working together create an analysis plan.
