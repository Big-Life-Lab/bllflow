# bllFlow package <img src="man/figures/pbl-sticker.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

bllFlow supports open, reproducible, efficient research. 

The package was originally developed for support prespecified predictive models in health, particularly when there are multiple people working together (content experts, analysts, etc.) to create an analysis plan. 

You can see bllFlow in action at {TBA}
