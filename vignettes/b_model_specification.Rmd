## Introduction
The Model Specification Workbook (MSW) is used to specify your model. The MSW is 
a series of four worksheets (CSV files) that describe different model components. 
You can use **bllflow** without a MSW but we recommend using the 
`variables` and `variable_details` worksheets. 
 
## The four MSW worksheets

- **variables.csv** - Each row in the `variables.csv` file is a variable in your model. 
The columns include variable labels, type, and other information such as which 
variables are transformed (centered, have dummy variables, restrictive cubic 
splines, have interaction terms, etc.).
- **variables_details.csv** - includes the details of each variable, including all 
category (factor) levels and labels. Also included are  specific variable transformation 
rules.
- **model_description.csv** - includes information such as the model name, outcome, 
model, creator(s), date and data set names.
- **table_description.csv** - includes specifications for how to create Table 1 
and other tables.

**bllFlow** also supports the use of DDI documents. If available, bllFlow labels 
and other information to the `variables.csv` and `variables_details.csv`, as well
as perserving data information to support data provenance.
