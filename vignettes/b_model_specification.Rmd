## Introduction


## Data templates
**bblFlow** has three Model Specfication Worksheets (MSW):

1) `MSW-variables` --- for all model variables (features).
1) `MSW-categories` --- for all category (factor) levels.

Include in each worksheet is metadata for specifying the model, including:

- variable labels
- data cleaning
- tranfromation rules

The 

We typically create a family of algorithms that consist of different outcomes 
using the same development cohort. We create "master" worksheets that contain 
variables used in any algorithm wtih a family of algorithms. As well as 
algorithm specific worksheets with data cleaning and transformation rules, such 
as max-min rules, that are specfic for each algorithm.
