## Introduction

This section is in progress. _bllflow_ has several helper functions, tables and 
plots to help describe and deploy predictive models, including exporting models in two formats:

  - Predictive Modelling Markup Language (PMML)
  - CSV files that correspond to the study data DDI file and Model Specification Workbook.

See the follow examples of how `bllflow` is used to report predictive models.
