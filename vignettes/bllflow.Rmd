“Flow” in _bllflow_ refers to the process of using the Model Specification Worksheet to perform rountine data cleaning and transformation, performance reporting, and model deployment. Go to [`Workflow`](a_workflow.html) to see _bllflow_'s seven steps to analysing observational data. You can pick and choose to use any steps that 
fit your own workflow.

## Workflow vignettes
Tne [`Workflow`](a_workflow.html) vignettes use the `pbc` data available in the `suvival` package to [replicate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2737595) a survival model for people with primary biliary cirrhosis.  What is the `pbc` data? The name, description and other information is included in the metadata file! 

See [`Example 4 - Helper and utility functions`](i_helper_functions.html). 

## Example - Study exclusion criteria
A typical first step when starting a new study is applying inclusion and exclusion criteria to the study data. In our PBC survival model, we will include only participants ages 40 to 70 years.

##### 1) Excluding participatns age < 40 or >70 years using `clean.Min()` and `clean.Max()`
```{r Clean with BBLFlow(), message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load libraries and pbc data (from survival)
library(survival)
data(pbc)
library(bllflow)

# read the MSW
# MSW includes columns 'min' and 'max' with rows for 'age' values 40 and 70.
variables <- read.csv(file.path(getwd(), '../inst/extdata/PBC-variables.csv'))
variableDetails <- read.csv(file.path(getwd(), '../inst/extdata/PBC-variableDetails.csv'))

# perform all data cleaning steps
pbcModel <-  BLLFlow(pbc, variables, variableDetails)
  cleanPbc <- clean.Min(pbcModel, print = TRUE)
  cleanPbc <- clean.Max(cleanPbc, print = TRUE)
```
Within the `PBC-variables.csv` file there is a column 'min' and 'max' and a row each variable. The 'age' variable has the values for 40 and 70 in the 'min' and 'max' columns. This example is shown in more detail in the [data cleaning and transformation](d_clean_data.Rmd) vignette. 

Note that executing `clean.Max` executes `min` and `max` criteria for all variables in the pbcModel.
