There there are two 
main features:

- The Model Specification Worksheet (MSW) - CSV files that contain key 
information (metadata) about the variables in your model.

- Formatted output files, tables and figures - CSV files that contain results of your model that adhere to 
reporting guidelines such as TRIPOD, STROBE, and RECORD.

"Flow" refers to the process of using the Model Specification Worksheet to 
perform rountine data cleaning and transformation, performance reporting, and
model deployment. The imperitive for bllFlow is the development of predictive 
models but key parts help research using routinely-collected data. 


## RStudio Plugin Installation

1. Restart the IDE
1. If the plugin was successfully installed there should be a new entry in the
   Addins menu at the top of the IDE called "R Project Builder"

## Plugin Usage

1. Open the project's 'Model Specification Worksheet (MSW)' (CSV file).
2. Run the plugin.
3. The generated project should be in a folder called "generated-project" within the folder
   containing the web specifications file.
   
The package requires a MSW CSV file that identifies:

1. Which variable you would like transformed.
2. Which transformation you would like performed.
