There there are two distictive features of **bllFlow** to facilitate open, 
reproducible and efficient research.

- The Model Specification Worksheet (MSW) - CSV files that contain key 
information (metadata) about the variables in your model.

- Formatted output files, tables and figures - CSV files that contain results of 
your model that adhere to reporting guidelines such as TRIPOD, STROBE, and RECORD.

"Flow" refers to the process of using the Model Specification Worksheet to 
perform rountine data cleaning and transformation, performance reporting, and
model deployment. The imperitive for bllFlow is the development of predictive 
models but key parts help research using routinely-collected data. 

At any point of your analyses you can:
- create a complete codebook.
- always have labels for variables and categories.
- always know (using variable attributes) how your data has been cleaned and 
transformed.

The workflow describes 7 steps:
