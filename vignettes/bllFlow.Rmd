The `Workflow` menu describes seven common analysis steps when performing 
research using observational data. You can choose to use any steps that 
fit your workflow.

There there are two distictive features of **bllflow** that facilitate open, 
reproducible and efficient research.

- The Model Specification Workbook (MSW) - CSV files that contain key 
information (metadata) about the variables in your model.

- Formatted output files, tables and figures - CSV files that containing results from
your model that adhere to reporting guidelines such as TRIPOD, STROBE, and RECORD.

"Flow" refers to the process of using the Model Specification Workbook to 
perform rountine data cleaning and transformation, performance reporting, and
model deployment. The imperitive for bllflow is the development of predictive 
models, but key parts help research using routinely-collected data. 

At any point of your analysis you:

- have a complete codebook;
- always have labels for variables and categories; and,
- always know (using variable attributes) how your data has been cleaned and 
transformed.
