## Introduction

This section is in progress. _bllflow_ use the Model Specification Workbook to provide instructions to generate:

- the PMML file that described how to calculate predictive algorithms.
- validation (testing) data.
- calibratin data.

See the following examples of how `bllflow` is used to report and deploy models.

  * Algorithms for indivdual use at [Project Big Life](https://www.projectbiglife.ca)
  * Application Program Interface [(API)](https://ottawa-mhealth.github.io/pbl-calculator-engine-docs/)
  * Algorithm deployment for population planning - Coming September 2019.
