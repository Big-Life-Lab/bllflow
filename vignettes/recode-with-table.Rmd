# RecWTable - Recode with Table

Recoding variables is a common task in research that is time consuming and error prone. RecWTable compliments sjmisc::rec() and other recoding methods with the following features:

- Rules for recoding are contained in a data.table. The data.table (default <- `variableDetails`) contains rules for recoding multiple variables. Each row comprises a category in a newly transformed variable. The syntax for recoding is the same as sjmisc::rec() -- see below -- and contained in variableDetails$from
- Variable labels and value labels for the newly transformed variable are assigned from `variableDetails`. Defaults: 
    + variable labels <- variableDetails$label
    + value (factor) labels <- variableDetails$valueLabel
    + variable units <- variableDetils$units
- VariableDetails labels and other metadata can be imported from an accompanying metadata file (DDI supported).
- Recoding from a continuous or categorical variabe to new categorical variable.
- Recoding from a categorical variable to either a new continuous or catecategorical variable (todo).
- Recoding to a common target variable from different variables in different databases. See below 'recoding to a common target variable'.
- A log of transformations can be printed to console.
- Additional features are available if `variableDetails` is a bllflow class. That is, `variableDetails `is passed as an attribute when creating a _bllflow_ object using `bllflow()`-- see [Speciying your model](vignettes/b_model_specification.html#reading-the-model-specification-workbook)
     + the log of recoding is appended to the _bllflow_ object. see....


Dataset??


RecWTable was created to follow sjmisc::rec(), except:

- the transformation rules are in `variableDetails`, as opposed to being defined as attributes within rec(). 
- variable labels, value labels, as.num and suffix reference a vector (variable) within `variableDetails`. The value are not directly passed to rec().
- `RecWTable()` has additional features to create and print a log.

For consideration: refactor how we define transformation in `variableDetails` to follow sjmic:rec(). 
For example in `variableDetails`: 

- the headings `low` and `high` would be combined into change to `from`. For example: `low = 20`, `high = 40` would change to `from = 20:40`. 
- allowable entries would include: `min`, `max`, `else` and `copy`. For example: `else = copy`.
- I don't think we need `rev`

----------

RecWTable(data, ..., variableDetails, label = TRUE, datasetName, else = NA, append = TRUE, log = TRUE, printLog = TRUE, printNote = TRUE, printNote = TRUE, predicate)

data: Data that contains starting variables for recoding. A vector or data frame.

...: The unquoted name(s) of variable(s) that are created during recoding, as defined in `variableDetails`. The variable(s) must exist in `variableDetails`. 

variableDetails: The data.table that contains the variables and corresponding rules and labels for recoding.

label: (@rusty, not sure if this needs to be a quoted character) If TRUE, will set variable label attribute for the returned variable from 'variableDetails$label' (if present).  If unquoted `name` will set variable label attribute from the corresponding string from from `variableDetails$name`. For example, use `shortLabel` to set label from `variableDetails$shortLabel`.  If empty, variable label attributes will be removed.

datasetName: The name of the data for starting variables. This is an optional (but recommended) check to ensure if startVariables correspond to correct data.

else: assigns values to all other values (aka out-of-range values) that cannot be recoded according to rules in `variableDetails`. `else` can also be defined as a rule in `variableDetails`. Default = NA, out-of-range values are assigned `NA`. If `copy`, then the out-of-range values are not recoded (maintain their original value).

append: Logical, if TRUE (the default) and `data` is a data frame, `data` including the new variables as additional columns is returned; if FALSE, only the new variables are returned.

log: Logical, if TRUE, creates log of recoding. default = TRUE.

printLog: Logical, if TRUE, prints summary of recoding to the console.

printNote: Logical, if TRUE, prints to console the contents of `variableDetails$notes` for variable. 

(@rusty, I'm not sure if we need `predicate`` in our transformation functions. It is in rjmisc and I am including so that we could our functionality with sjmisc.)

predicate: A predicate function to be applied to the columns. The variables for which predicate returns TRUE are selected.

Notes: 
1) If a startVariable is not present in the data, should we consider whether it is an intermediary variable, and then transform (recode) that variable? An intermediary variable is a variable that exists as a variable variableDetails (it is created by variables in `data` and then used in a transformation with other)

For initial version, give warnings and errors only.
If missing intermediary variable: “Error: recoding {variable} requires {startVariable} variable. Recode available in {variableDetails}. Suggest first recoding {startVariable} variable, then try again.”

If missing startVariable (altogether): “Error: missing required starting variable(s): {startingVariable}”

2) Check to make sure all possible values are recoded. What should we do if values cannot be recoded? See outOfRange = NA

3) Return error if any required fields are missing, including: startVarible, type, etc.

4) Log example:
“{variable} created from: startVariables.
Observations: {n}
type: {continuous, factor, etc.}
(if continuous:) min: {min}, max: {min}, NA: {n of missing} 
(if factor:) {n} factors, NA: {n of missing}”
