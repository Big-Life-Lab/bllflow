## Introduction

This section is in progress. _bllflow_ supports a pre-specified approach to 
model development, but otherwise does not have an opinionated model development 
approach. 

Vignette examples will develop the `pbc` model following the original study's 
cox proportional hazard approach using functions in base R and the 'Hmisc' 
package.
